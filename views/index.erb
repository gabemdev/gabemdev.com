    <p>Hi, I'm Gabe. I'm a software developer in Texas. I build things at work and at home. I have a <a href="/blog">blog</a> but hardly write on it.
    </p>

    <p>
    I've been making apps since 2011. While some of the apps I worked on were internal projects, a handful of them made it to the App Store.
    </p>
    <p><br>
    Currently, I work <b>@BneiBaruch</b> as lead iOS Developer and I also freelance part-time. I spend most of my day writing code. I also give HTML courses in town.
    </p>
