    <p>Hi, I'm Gabe. I am a iOS Developer, Rails apprentince, and taco connoisseur. I live in Texas with my wife and daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
    Currently, I work <b>@BneiBaruch</b> as lead iOS Developer and part-time freelancer. You can <a href="">hire me</a>. Check out some of my <a href="">projects</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have a bachelors in computer science but graduated in 2004, that's before mobile or even dynamic websites. In 2010, I decided to learn iOS. I quit my not so great insurance job after 8 years. I can't describe it but it was the first time I smiled in a very long time. In early 2011, I finally landed my first iOS position and haven't looked back.
