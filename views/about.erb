            Hello, I'm Gabe. I'm a iOS and Web developer. I live in Austin, Texas with my beautiful wife and daughter.
            </p>

            <p>
            Currently, I work <b>@Phunware</b> as Software Engineer - iOS and part-time freelancer. You can <a href="">hire me</a>. Check our some of my <a href="/work">projects</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
            I have a bachelors in computer science but graduated in 2004, that's before mobile or even dynamic websites. In 2010, I decided to learn iOS. I quit my not so great insurance job after 8 years. I can't describe it but it was the first time I smiled in a very long time. In early 2011, I finally landed my first iOS position and haven't looked back.
